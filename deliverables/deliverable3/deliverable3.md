IS2955 - Software Testing
Summer Semester 2015

Deliverable 3
Assigned 24 JUNE 2014
Due 8 JULY 2014

For this assignment, your group will write systems tests for a web site using the BDD model discussed in class.  That is, you will wrie user stories (features) and scenarios, and then write tests for those scenarios using Selenium.

Tests and code should be on Github or another publicly accessible repository. Code sent in via email will receive a 10% penalty.

Format:
Every group should have a title page with:
The name of the project under test
The names of the people in the group
The title CS1699 - DELIVERABLE 3: Systems Testing with BDD

First, include a short summary (a few paragraphs) of what you decided to test, and why.

Secondly, add a description of issues you faced when writing these tests and problems you would expect going forward based on your experiences.  If any tests you wrote fail, they should be included here.  Also note if there are any special steps to get the tests running.

At the end of this section, note where your code (test code and code of project under test) is located.

After this, there should be a printout or screen shot of the test execution results.

There is no need to print out the code.  It should be put on a publicly-available site such as Github BY THE BEGINNING OF CLASS.

There shall be AT LEAST 5 user stories per assignment, but there can be more. Each user story should have multiple (at least two) scenarios.

There shall be at least (5 * (number of people in group)) scenarios.

User stories should all follow the Connextra template.

Scenarios should all follow the Given/When/Then template (but note that some senarios may not require a Given).

Remember that scenarios are FEATURE-level tests; they should discuss things ina way that an intelligent but non-technical user of the software would understand.  Remember the differences between scenario tests and specification/unit tests!

Grading:
Summary - 5%
Testing concerns - 10%
Screen shot or printout of test results - 5%
User Stories and Scenarios - 30%
Test code - 50%

Reminder that all code (project under test AND test code) should be publicly available, or at least available to me, preferably on Github.
