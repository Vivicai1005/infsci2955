IS2955  Midterm Study Guide
Summer 2015
---------------------------

The midterm will cover everything we have covered up to the lecture of 10 JUNE 2015.

However, here are the key topics to study in preparation for the test.

TESTING THEORY AND TERMINOLOGY:
Equivalence class partitioning
Boundary and "interior" values
Base, Edge, and Corner cases
Static vs Dynamic testing
   -> Know the differences and examples of each
Black/White/Grey box testing
   -> Know the differences and examples of each

REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS:
What makes a good or bad requirement?
Testability - requirements must be:
   Complete, consistent, unambiguous, quantitative, feasible
Functional Requirements vs Non-Functional (Quality Attributes)
  -> Be able to define and write your own
Traceability Matrices
  -> Be able to define and write your own

TEST PLANS:
Terminology: test cases, test plans, test suites, test runs
The Seven Testing Principles
   -> You don't need to remember their names, but use them in developing test plans
Verification vs validation
Test case statuses: PASSED, FAILED, PAUSED, RUNNING, BLOCKED, ERROR
Be prepared to write your own test plan for a simple program

DEFECT REPORTING:
Be prepared to report a defect based on a test case
Remember the defect template:
SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, REPRODUCTION STEPS, EXPECTED BEHAVIOR, OBSERVED BEHAVIOR
optionally: SEVERITY/IMPACT, NOTES
Levels of severity: BLOCKER, CRITICAL, MAJOR, NORMAL, MINOR, TRIVIAL
Enhancements vs defects
   -> Be prepared to argue if something is a defect or enhancement
Coding mistakes vs defects

AUTOMATED TESTING:
Pros and cons of automated testing
Unit tests vs system/acceptance/integration tests
Writing automated tests:
PRECONDITIONS, POSTCONDITIONS, EXECUTION STEPS, INPUT/OUTPUT VALUES

UNIT TESTING:
Be prepared to write some unit tests in JUnit
Pay special attention to assertions
Stubs, mocks, and verification
Be able to explain code coverage and what it's good for/not good for

INTERACTING WITH STAKEHOLDERS:
Be able to name some stakeholders and what is important to them
Be prepared for some "fake" interaction with various stakeholders
